Repo for code for two papers relating random matrix theory, self excluding point processes and eukaryotic DNA replication, written by Nina Snaith and Huw Day. Links to be added:

- Thinned COE random matrix models for DNA replication
- Stochastic Model for Eukaryotic DNA replication

Code written primarily by Huw Day but with some debugging from Fahd Abelazim from the Ask-JGI data science helpdesk.
